      "title": "What should I consider while buying a battery?",
      "content": "There are multiple factors that must be considered while buying a battery. However, battery size, warranty, and power (CCA and RC) are some of the most important aspects to consider."
    },
    {
      "title": "What does CCA mean?",
      "content": "CCA stands for Cold Cranking Amps, which is a rating used to define the battery’s ability to start the engine of a vehicle in cold temperatures. The CCA rating is determined by the number of amps a fully charged new battery can deliver for 30 seconds at 0° F. In short, the higher the CCA rating, the better the battery starting power. "
    },
    {
      "title": "What does RC mean?",
      "content": "RC stands for Reserve Capacity, which is a battery rating that defines its ability to power up a vehicle with a fan belt or inoperative alternator. RC rating is the number of minutes a battery takes to discharge at 80° F and 25 amps. The higher the RC rating, the longer the vehicle’s operating capacity in case of fan belt or alternator failure."
